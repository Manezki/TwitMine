# TwitMine
As more and more people are creating content on Internet, the amount of available data is growing fast.<br>
Solely Twitter is producing [500 million tweets per day](http://www.internetlivestats.com/twitter-statistics/) which can provide valuable insights to the overall opinions.<br>
<br>
For this purpose, TwitMine for generated. Currently we do only
sentiment analysis to "positive", "neutral" and "negative" ( which 
itself can provide decent understanding about a brand ). What
sets this apart from the others, we are processing tweets charcter by character - because "GREAT" is different than "great". <br>
<br>
Currently quite limited by the labeled data - but with the datasets that we currently have in use, our precision for correct label is ~59%.
